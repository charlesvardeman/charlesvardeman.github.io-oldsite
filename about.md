If you "google" the definitions of the words in the name of this blog, the following
definition for semantic is returned...

<amp-img width="600" height="300" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/semantic.png"></amp-img>

and likewise with musing...

<amp-img width="600" height="300" layout="responsive" src="/assets/images/musing.png"></amp-img>

One can from the "implicit semantics" of the words discern that this blog is "about"
thinking or reflecting about meaning. And at one level, this is in fact set of topics
I intended to explore here. To a machine, that would not be enough to understand
that is blog is really about how machines perceive semantics and formal cognition and a
exploration of the tools to share human semantics with machine cognition and would require "deeper semantics" to convey that meaning.

This is a space where I will explore (at least what I consider) interesting research,
tools, techniques, algorithms and best practices for capturing formal semantics in a
machine centric form as well as a look at ways machines can 'inductively' and 'deductively'
process knowledge. The types of tools that I will touch on are born of the [Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/) and [Linked Open Data](http://linkeddata.org/) communities
such as [Ontology Design Patterns](ontologydesignpatterns.org), [Knowledge Graphs](https://www.google.com/intl/bn/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html) that are
computational methods for deductively processing knowledge as well as tools that inductively
process knowledge such as Machine Learning and [Deep Neural Networks](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602344/the-extraordinary-link-between-deep-neural-networks-and-the-nature-of-the-universe/).

This blog is intended to cover topics from both a practical perspective of how programmers can
implement ideas from the semantic web into their own projects as well as topics from research and more
the theoretical aspects with which my area of computational research concerns itself. From that perspective, I hope many diverse topics will find their way into the pages of this blog. Lastly, this
is intended as a place where I can 'try' to make sense of some of the more abstract concepts with machine based cognition and give methodologies of how to apply them in a practical way.
